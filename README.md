 RGAC Virtual University 🎓
A revolutionary virtual university platform leveraging metaverse technology, VR labs, and AI-driven tools to democratize accessible, practical, and affordable education. Table of Contents

 Introduction 📚

### Problem Statement
Traditional universities face challenges like high costs (up to ₹2,15,000/year), inefficient time utilization (70% wasted on exams), 
lack of practical training, and inaccessibility for rural/marginalized students. Graduates often lack hands-on experience with tools like Arduino, sensors, and microcontrollers.

### Objectives
- Provide affordable (₹20,000–₹40,000/year), high-quality education.
- Emphasize skill-based, job-oriented training.
- Reduce dependency on physical infrastructure and exams.
- Ensure equal access for all backgrounds.
- Leverage VR, AI, and online platforms for practical learning.

### Scope
- **Educational Access**: Affordable courses in ECE, CSE, and Robotics.
- **Technology Integration**: VR labs, metaverse campuses, AI tutoring.
- **Skill Development**: Simulations for hardware/software experimentation.
- **Inclusivity**: Reach rural and underprivileged communities.
- **Scalability**: Cloud infrastructure for global access.
